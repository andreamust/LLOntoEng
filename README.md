# NeOn-GPT: Ontology Modeling using NeOn Methodology with GPT-driven Workflow

NeOn-GPT is a cutting-edge project that combines the power of NeOn methodology with the advanced capabilities of the GPT language model to revolutionize the way ontology modeling is approached. This project aims to streamline the ontology development process by leveraging the NeOn methodology's best practices and employing GPT's natural language generation capabilities to iteratively construct a comprehensive ontology. 

**NeOn Methodology Integration:** NeOn-GPT stands at the crossroads of two powerful technologies: ontology modeling methodologies and artificial intelligence. The NeOn methodology, known for its structured and iterative approach, provides the foundation for the project's workflow. It guides the ontology development process through distinct phases such as requirements analysis, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and maintenance. By incorporating the NeOn methodology, this project ensures that the resulting ontology is not only logically robust but also aligned with domain requirements.

**GPT-Driven Workflow:** What sets NeOn-GPT apart is its intelligent workflow powered by GPT. At each step of ontology development, GPT assists in generating relevant and coherent content that refines the ontology's structure and content. The GPT-driven workflow begins with user inputs or high-level descriptions of the domain, and through a series of interactions, it incrementally refines concepts, relationships, and axioms. This not only accelerates the development process but also opens avenues for domain experts and developers to collaborate effectively, even if they lack deep ontology modeling expertise.

Furthermore, NeOn-GPT seamlessly integrates external tools and technologies to enhance the ontology's quality and rigor.

**OOPS APIs and Hermit Reasoner Integration:** To ensure the soundness and accuracy of the developed ontology, NeOn-GPT integrates the OntolOgy Pitfall Scanner (OOPS) APIs. These APIs are employed to perform validation checks, syntactic analysis, and consistency testing on the ontology. In addition, the Hermit reasoner is employed to conduct in-depth reasoning and inference tasks, verifying the logical coherence of the ontology's axioms and concepts. By harnessing these tools, NeOn-GPT guarantees that the ontology conforms to established standards and exhibits robust logical reasoning capabilities.

Whether you are an ontology expert looking to enhance your development process or a domain enthusiast aiming to create structured first draft knowledge representations, this project offers a pioneering approach that combines methodologies, AI, and reasoning tools to reshape the approach to knowledge graphs generation.
